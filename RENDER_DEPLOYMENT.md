# Vercel frontend and split Render backend

This is the canonical deployment guide for all three repositories. Production runs the React UI on Vercel and uses **one non-root backend image with separate Render `web` and `worker` roles**. Six BaSyx services run separately on one Oracle Cloud VM behind Caddy and use an Aiven PostgreSQL database. Kubernetes is unnecessary. Managed databases, messaging and Redis remain external; Pi/ESP32/ADA031 equipment stays on the OT network.

## What runs where

| Process | Role and bind address | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Node API | web: `0.0.0.0:$PORT` | Accounts, sessions, role enforcement, assets, incidents, Assistant, dashboard queries and private telemetry ingress |
| DeviceService | web: `127.0.0.1:3102` | AAS provisioning/import and gateway commands |
| TelemetryService | worker: `0.0.0.0:$PORT` health endpoint | Persistent MQTT intake, PostgreSQL storage and retryable dashboard/event delivery |
| IdentityService | web: `127.0.0.1:3104` | Current dashboard profile/role checks; no separate account store or Entra login |
| AnalyticsService | web: `127.0.0.1:3105` | SQL sample coverage, gaps and null-safe metrics for selected assets |
| NotificationService | worker: `127.0.0.1:3106` | Durable incident and account-email delivery through Gmail SMTP or Resend |

Outside Render, the Oracle VM runs the AAS Repository, AAS Registry, Submodel Repository, Submodel Registry, Concept Description Repository, and AASX File Server. Caddy exposes HTTPS component paths and the client-credentials token endpoint; ports 8081–8086 bind to loopback. These services share the dedicated Aiven `basyx` database.

Supervisor restarts failed processes and forwards shutdown signals. Web readiness verifies the dashboard database, Redis, DeviceService, IdentityService and AnalyticsService. Worker readiness is served by TelemetryService; Supervisor independently restarts NotificationService if it exits. `/health/live` remains available during dependency outages. Private APIs do not appear as public Render routes. The Node API delegates identity/analytics calls using a separate service token and the authenticated account ID; the services reload the current account from PostgreSQL.

## Local development

1. Keep the three checkouts side by side. Install Docker Compose v2, Node 22/pnpm 10.34.5, Python 3.11 and .NET 8 SDK/runtime (or run .NET checks in its SDK image).
2. Copy the dashboard and backend `.env.local.example` files to ignored `.env.local` files. Replace every placeholder. Share `JWT_SECRET`, `AAS_PROVISIONING_TOKEN`, `INGESTION_API_TOKEN`, `DASHBOARD_SERVICE_TOKEN` and the dashboard Redis password only with their intended callers. Backend database and broker passwords remain separate.
3. Set the backend `DASHBOARD_DATABASE_CONNECTION` to `Host=database;Database=smart_factory_iot;Username=smartfactory_local;Password=<dashboard database password>;SSL Mode=Disable`. Use a valid Npgsql quoted value if the password contains separators. Set the dashboard `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=compose` and `ALLOWED_ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000`.
4. From the dashboard repository start `docker compose --env-file .env.local --profile aas up --build -d --wait`. The dashboard database is on the shared development network. From the backend repository start `docker compose --env-file .env.local up --build -d --wait`. Open `http://localhost:3000` after both are ready. Local Compose migrations run before workers; the default simulated path uses only local services.
5. Follow the edge [workstation gateway profile](https://github.com/DruHustle/smart-factory-iot-edge/blob/master/raspberry-pi/README.md#complete-local-three-repository-test) for simulated telemetry. The physical Pi connects to its configured CloudAMQP broker, while local TelemetryService defaults to Docker RabbitMQ. For a physical Pi-to-local-dashboard check, configure the backend `TELEMETRY_MQTT_*` variables with a separate CloudAMQP read-only subscriber account before starting/recreating TelemetryService. Local ports bind to loopback and plaintext local protocols must stay off public/OT networks.

When running the Node API on the host, use `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=local`, the host PostgreSQL/Redis addresses and `AAS_PROVISIONING_API_URL=http://127.0.0.1:5001/api/assets`. Identity/Analytics/Notification delegation uses their documented host ports 5002/5004/5003. `standalone` disables that delegation for isolated dashboard tests.

For exact Render-image acceptance without cloud credentials, build the bundle below then run `python3 scripts/bundle-smoke.py`. Its databases, broker and Redis are disposable, its UI/API port is 3110, and its synthetic accounts are removed on exit. It deliberately does not run plant equipment or send real email. `pnpm e2e` separately tests the browser at `E2E_PORT=3100`; `pnpm e2e:system` tests real AAS/MQTT/Pi paths with simulated serial equipment and requires the local BaSyx stack.

## Build the shared backend image

Run from the dashboard repository using a new output directory:

```bash
python3 scripts/prepare-backend-context.py ../smart-factory-iot-backend /tmp/factory-backend-context
# For a local test on the current architecture:
docker buildx build --load --build-context backend=/tmp/factory-backend-context -f deploy/render/Dockerfile -t smart-factory-render-review:local .
python3 scripts/bundle-smoke.py
```

The context preparer includes only source/project/migration files and excludes local settings, secrets and build artifacts. Production releases use the coordinated workflow below to build `linux/amd64`, test it, and publish that same image by digest. This is the **only production backend image**; it contains the Node API and all five .NET services.

The React frontend is a separate immutable Vercel build artifact, produced with `vercel build --prod` and uploaded with `vercel deploy --prebuilt --prod`. It is not a second Docker image: Vercel serves the static output and proxies `/api/*` to the Render web service. Do not put database, broker, AAS, email-provider or Assistant secrets in Vercel build variables.

The runtime uses the supported .NET 8 Ubuntu 24.04 base with OS security updates. Node entries are compiled during build, and the runtime install contains only the API dependency subset selected from the frozen lockfile. npm, Corepack, tsx, esbuild, Vite and drizzle-kit remain in build stages. Committed dashboard migrations run through the Drizzle ORM migrator using the same verified PostgreSQL connection as the API.

## Render service settings

Create **two paid, image-backed services** from the same reviewed GHCR digest. Disable Render's independent auto-deploy setting on both; the coordinated GitHub workflow deploys the worker first and the web tier second.

| Setting | Web service | Worker service |
|---|---|---|
| `RENDER_SERVICE_ROLE` | `web` | `worker` |
| Health check path | `/health/live` | `/health/live` |
| Instances | Two fixed instances, or autoscaling with minimum two | Exactly one |
| Persistent disk | None | At least 1 GB at `/var/data` as a sequential-rollout safeguard |
| Public origin | Used by Vercel | Set as `DASHBOARD_API_ORIGIN` on the worker |
| Processes | Node API, Device, Identity, Analytics | Telemetry MQTT consumer, Notification delivery |

Set `RENDER_SERVICE_ROLE=web` on the web service and `RENDER_SERVICE_ROLE=worker` on the worker service. Do not leave either production service on the backward-compatible `all` role.

Render must use `/health/live` for instance health and deployment port detection. Use `/health/ready` only for diagnostics and release verification because it intentionally returns `503` while a database, MQTT or another required dependency is unavailable. During startup it names the active dashboard, device, or telemetry migration stage. The coordinated release allows up to twelve minutes for readiness recovery, while each migration command is bounded to ten minutes; non-text upstream error pages are omitted from CI logs.

The stateless web tier has no disk, so Render can load-balance replicas and perform zero-downtime rolling deployments. The worker remains single-instance because it owns the stable MQTT client ID. Its disk prevents deployment overlap; application data remains in PostgreSQL and Redis. Give the worker a dedicated stable `MqttClientId` when migrating from the legacy all-in-one service. Stable ingestion IDs make the short cutover overlap idempotent.

Render disks disable multiple instances and zero-downtime deployment, so never attach one to the web tier. Do not scale the worker above one without redesigning MQTT consumer ownership. The [pre-deploy command](https://render.com/docs/deploys) runs separately and cannot access an attached disk.

## Required runtime configuration

Set these values in Render's secret/environment settings, never in Git:

| Variables | Requirement |
|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL`, `DATABASE_SSL_MODE=verify-full`, `DATABASE_CA_CERT` | Dashboard Aiven URL and trusted provider PEM CA, including hostname verification |
| `DEVICE_DATABASE_CONNECTION`, `TELEMETRY_DATABASE_CONNECTION` | Npgsql strings with `SSL Mode=VerifyFull;Root Certificate=/run/secrets/aiven-ca.pem` and the correct separate databases/users |
| `REDIS_URL` | Authenticated Redis Cloud `rediss://` URL |
| `JWT_SECRET`, `AAS_PROVISIONING_TOKEN`, `INGESTION_API_TOKEN`, `DASHBOARD_SERVICE_TOKEN` | Four distinct random secrets of at least 32 bytes |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGIN` | Exact production Vercel/custom UI origin; explicit trusted preview origins only if needed |
| `TRUST_PROXY` | Verified Render proxy IP/CIDR ranges or a validated fixed hop topology; test client-IP attribution before enabling production login throttling |
| `MqttBrokerHost`, `MqttBrokerPort=8883`, `MqttUsername`, `MqttPassword`, `MqttClientId` | CloudAMQP TLS credentials, scoped telemetry consumption and a stable unique client ID |
| `EDGE_SITE_ID`, `EDGE_LINE_ID` | Match the commissioned gateway command topic scope |
| AAS repository/registry/file-server URLs and OIDC client configuration | Private HTTPS company endpoints; see [AAS configuration](docs/AASX-and-Edge-Configuration.md) |

The web service requires the dashboard, Redis, device, identity, analytics, AAS and authorization settings. The worker requires the dashboard and telemetry database settings, MQTT settings, email-provider settings, service tokens, and `DASHBOARD_API_ORIGIN=https://<web-service>.onrender.com`. Keep matching `INGESTION_API_TOKEN` and `DASHBOARD_SERVICE_TOKEN` values on both services.

The entrypoint writes the CA to a private file under `/tmp` and configures verified Npgsql connections for the dashboard-backed services. Demo accounts and simulated data default off; an intentionally public demonstration tenant can explicitly set `ENABLE_DEMO_ACCOUNTS=true` and `ENABLE_DEMO_DATA=true`. This publishes fixed credentials including a demo administrator and must never be used with sensitive data, production identities, live equipment or robot controls. Image defaults are `NODE_ENV=production`, `DOTNET_ENVIRONMENT=Production`, `ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production`, `API_ONLY=true`, `BACKEND_DEPLOYMENT_MODE=render-bundle`. It assigns private loopback routes and the dynamic public `PORT`; no hard-coded external backend URL is required for telemetry forwarding.

Identity/Analytics/Notification each cap their database pool at 20 connections. Budget these pools plus Node, EF services, pre-deploy jobs and AAS against provider limits. Restrict provider ingress to approved egress addresses, use scoped database permissions, and monitor queue age/depth and spool capacity. Different read-only credentials for identity/analytics are a future hardening step: the current three services share the dashboard database connection in the bundle.

Public registration is disabled in production. Bootstrap the first admin through the private Render shell/job with temporary `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL`, `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (12–72 UTF-8 bytes) and optional `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_NAME`, then run `node scripts/bootstrap-admin.mjs`. This serialized command refuses to run if an admin already exists and never prints passwords. Remove the temporary secrets afterward. Administrators create further accounts in **User access** and provide their credentials through approved private channels. Development registration creates a viewer and cannot choose its role. There is no default production password or demo admin. Keep account promotion audit records outside the application until a full account audit log is implemented.

## Oracle BaSyx VM

Infrastructure code lives in the backend repository under `deploy/terraform/oracle-basyx`; the runtime Compose stack lives under `deploy/oracle-basyx`. Authenticate OCI, create and review `terraform.tfvars`, then run `terraform init`, `terraform validate`, `terraform plan`, and apply only after Oracle shows an Always Free-eligible zero-cost allocation. The module creates the Ubuntu ARM64 VM, network, restricted SSH rule, and Docker host, while keeping database and OAuth secrets out of Terraform state.

On the VM, copy the Compose directory, create its untracked `.env`, and set the Aiven host/port, dedicated `basyx_service` user/password/database, OAuth client ID/secret, and separate gateway bearer token. Run `docker compose run --rm configuration` once, then `docker compose up -d`, and verify each `/description` route through HTTPS. Point Render's six AAS component URLs and token URL at the Caddy paths. Keep 8081–8086 loopback-only, restrict SSH, rotate bootstrap secrets, back up Aiven, and validate create/import/delete/profile flows before plant use.

## Transactional email

The inbox and account creation work without email delivery. The current provider is Gmail SMTP: set `EMAIL_PROVIDER=smtp`, `SMTP_HOST=smtp.gmail.com`, `SMTP_PORT=587`, `SMTP_USERNAME`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`, and `SMTP_FROM`. `SMTP_PASSWORD` must be a Google app password stored only in the Render worker environment. Set `SMTP_ALLOW_ALL_RECIPIENTS=true` for signup mail, or use the explicit recipient/domain allowlists for a restricted deployment.

Resend remains available by setting `EMAIL_PROVIDER=resend` and configuring all of `RESEND_API_KEY`, `RESEND_FROM`, and `RESEND_ALLOWED_RECIPIENT_DOMAINS`. Partial provider configuration fails closed. All credentials remain server-side.

Welcome emails may go to newly created accounts allowed by the configured recipient policy. Incident and assignment/resolution emails go only to current engineer/admin dashboard accounts. The sender is fixed server-side. Incident insertion and assignment/resolution updates enqueue inbox records in the same PostgreSQL transaction via migration 0013. The worker claims jobs with a lease, retries up to eight failed attempts with bounded backoff, and retains failed requests. Authorized owners can retry eligible requests after configuration is corrected. Unconfigured or unauthorized recipients are displayed explicitly.

Provider acceptance is recorded as **accepted**, never as confirmed mailbox delivery. Messages include the application notification ID as a custom header for correlation. Resend requests also use its idempotency key; SMTP delivery is at least once and a retry after an ambiguous timeout can duplicate a message. Validate the sender account, recipient restrictions, throttling and a controlled test mailbox before enabling factory notifications.

## Vercel settings

Set the project's Install Command to `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, Build Command to `pnpm build`, Output Directory to `dist/public`, and the build variable `VITE_API_URL=/api`. Vercel hosts the static React app only.

Before Vercel reads deployment configuration, run `RENDER_API_ORIGIN=https://<render-service>.onrender.com pnpm vercel:configure`. This replaces the deliberate `.invalid` placeholder in `vercel.json` with the actual HTTPS Render origin. `/api/*` is an external rewrite; SPA routes fall back to `/index.html`. API responses are private/non-cacheable. The browser uses first-party HttpOnly session cookies through the Vercel proxy and never receives service tokens. [External rewrites](https://vercel.com/docs/routing/rewrites) support this proxy; their [120-second timeout](https://vercel.com/docs/limits) also applies to large AASX imports. Test representative uploads through Vercel, not just directly against Render. The UI uses HTTP polling; it does not require Vercel WebSocket hosting.

Disable Vercel's independent Git production deployment for this project. The coordinated workflow configures the Render rewrite, runs `vercel pull`, builds the production artifact, and deploys that exact prebuilt artifact with pinned CLI 62.2.0 only after Render is live and ready. Keeping Vercel's built-in Git deployment enabled would create a second, unordered production path. Verify login, cookie forwarding, logout, multi-user IP attribution and protected mutations on the actual UI custom domain.

## CI/CD and rollback

Each repository has pinned-action quality CI. The dashboard's `.github/workflows/release.yml` is the only production release path. A push to the dashboard repository's protected `main` branch starts the coordinated production release automatically. It resolves the current backend `main` and edge `master` heads to immutable 40-character SHAs, checks out all three revisions, runs dashboard/browser, .NET and gateway tests, compiles ESP32 firmware, validates documentation and deployment configuration, builds the single Linux backend image and runs its acceptance checks. No firmware is flashed by CI.

`workflow_dispatch` remains available for a controlled rerun or rollback. Leave its optional companion SHA fields empty to use backend `main` and edge `master`, or provide full lowercase 40-character backend and edge SHAs. Protect the dashboard/backend `main` branches and the edge `master` branch, require pull-request review and required quality checks, and restrict the GitHub `production` environment so a direct unreviewed push cannot bypass organizational approval policy.

Backend CI and the coordinated release audit all direct/transitive NuGet dependencies and fail on high/critical findings or unavailable audit data. The release scans the exact runtime image with checksum-verified Trivy 0.75.0 before publication. `python3 scripts/audit-container.py` repeats this locally on Linux x86_64 or macOS arm64. This standalone scan disables telemetry, restricts image access to the local Docker daemon and downloads only public vulnerability data; it does not upload source, images or results. High/critical findings, including unfixed ones, fail the gate. The workflow retains the JSON scan evidence; no vulnerabilities are ignored.

Edge CI and the coordinated release also audit the full pinned gateway dependency tree with pip-audit 2.10.1 and `--strict`; known vulnerabilities or incomplete dependency collection fail the gate. The firmware compile uses pinned platform/libraries. These application checks do not scan the installed Pi OS or certify ESP32/vendor firmware security.

The release job downloads and publishes the exact tested image, writes a three-repository source/digest manifest, deploys Render through its API and waits for that specific deployment to become live and ready. Only then does it build and deploy the matching Vercel UI artifact. Missing configuration fails the workflow; it cannot silently report a skipped deployment as success. Production releases are serialized and are not canceled mid-deploy.

GitHub `production` environment secrets: `RENDER_API_KEY`, `VERCEL_TOKEN`, `VERCEL_ORG_ID`, `VERCEL_PROJECT_ID`. Environment variables: `RENDER_WEB_SERVICE_ID`, `RENDER_WORKER_SERVICE_ID`, `RENDER_WEB_API_ORIGIN`. If companion repositories are private, add `REPOSITORY_READ_TOKEN` as a repository- or organization-level Actions secret because the verification job reads it before entering the `production` environment; scope it to read only the two companion repositories. `GITHUB_TOKEN` publishes GHCR with package-write permission only in the release job. Runtime database, broker, email and Assistant secrets remain exclusively in Render. Configure these values before the first push-triggered release; missing values intentionally fail the release rather than silently skipping a provider.

The pre-deploy task runs committed Drizzle migrations, idempotent telemetry SQL under an advisory lock, and DeviceService EF migrations. It never generates schema changes or seeds demo accounts. Migration 0013 does not email historical incidents. Migration 0014 enforces case-insensitive unique account emails; review and reconcile any pre-existing duplicates before migration rather than merging identities automatically. Take verified backups before applying migrations to an existing production database, and test migration compatibility on a restored copy.

Rollback is a reviewed release of the previous recorded image digest followed by the previous Vercel deployment. Never force-push source branches, automatically reverse schema migrations, or assume deployment rollback undoes schema/data changes. Keep additive migrations compatible with the prior API until rollout is accepted. Restore databases only through the documented provider recovery process and a tested recovery objective. Old Kubernetes, Cloudflare and ACR configurations are historical references, not parallel production release paths.

## Acceptance before plant use

See the [review evidence and remaining release gates](docs/production-readiness-review.md). Live managed-provider TLS/ACLs, Gmail SMTP mailbox delivery, Vercel proxy behavior, load/capacity, backup restoration, OT commissioning and hardware movement require deployment-specific evidence. Automated OTA remains unavailable in this release; bench firmware flashing and manual Pi deployment are documented in the edge guides. Do not advertise OTA as completed based on a dashboard database record.
