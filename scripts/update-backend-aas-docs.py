| Variable | Purpose |

Use the IDTA API 3.2 registry interface descriptor (`AAS-3.2`) with a matching repository endpoint. Keep these services on private networks and allow only the required service identities.

### Revision-aware form updates

`PUT /api/assets` requires `expectedAasVersion` and `aasVersion = expectedAasVersion + 1`. DeviceService reads the current shell and generated submodel revisions before updating the repository and registry. A stale edit returns HTTP 409. It keeps prior remote JSON in memory during the update and attempts compensating PUTs if a later resource update fails. The dashboard stores append-only snapshots in PostgreSQL and serializes edits per asset; the remote AAS services do not share a transaction with PostgreSQL. Imported AASX models are preserved and are not edited through this form endpoint.

DeviceService also exposes private dashboard-to-service endpoints under `/api/assets`. Every endpoint requires the separate `X-AAS-Provisioning-Token` service credential, compared in constant time; do not send a user JWT or expose DeviceService publicly.

| Method | Route | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| POST | `/api/assets` | Create and register a form-generated AAS shell, submodels, and registry descriptor. |
| PUT | `/api/assets` | Update a form-managed AAS with `expectedAasVersion` and the next `aasVersion`; returns 409 for stale revisions. |
| POST | `/api/assets/import` | Validate and import an AASX package, bounded to 50 MB and 25 shells. |
| DELETE | `/api/assets/import` | Compensate a failed cross-service AASX database commit using the receipt returned by the importer. |
| POST | `/api/assets/sync` | Validate and publish a gateway's complete desired-state profile. |

Set `AAS_REPOSITORY_URL` for shells/submodels and `AAS_REGISTRY_URL` for shell descriptors. DeviceService obtains OAuth tokens from `AAS_OIDC_TOKEN_URL` using its client id and secret. `AASX_FILE_SERVER_URL` points to the private package service. `PUT` checks the repository revision before writing and returns HTTP 409 when the expected revision is stale; the dashboard keeps the immutable revision snapshots in PostgreSQL.
